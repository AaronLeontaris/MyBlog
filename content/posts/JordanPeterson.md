# Why this topic?

I have been encountering mentions of Jordan B. Peterson for some time now.  
First was it by some friends or rather acquaintances trying to self improve and get along with their insurance/pyramid schema projects, also the name pop up a lot in social media aswell on diffrent media publications which can be considered left or if vogue leftist (if so desired).   
But recently I also heard mentions of him by friends i conscider very smart and who are close to my heart.  
Therefore I asked [Magda](https://www.instagram.com/begier_official/) to send me a content piece to listen to before judging about him.   
While listening to the Epsiode called: "How To Change The World" I got so angry because a lot of his view points resamble, in my opinion, the condensed problems of modern society.  
So here is my analysis of [the transcript](https://steno.ai/the-jordan-b-peterson-podcast/15-how-to-change-the-world) of the Podcast:

*There will be sections where is IMO little contents therefore i will minimize them.*

# The Great Missconception about Science  


> Yeah. Hi there. This is my message to millennials about how to change the world and I would say how to change the world properly. Um of course, the question then is, well, exactly what do you mean by properly? And of course that's the fundamental issue. So this was triggered in part by something I read recently by Jonathan hate and Jonathan Hate is the professor of ethical leadership at the N. Y. U. Stern School of Business and he's been a very astute commentator recently on some of the political battles that have been going on in the social sciences. Um, noting for example that there is very little political diversity in the views of social scientists and perhaps even less on the part of the people in the humanities um and Hate recently wrote something which I'll put you linked to in the description of this video where he claimed that universities have to decide between social justice and truth and on the side of truth, he puts philosopher call named john Stuart mill and english philosopher who said he who knows only his side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be good and no one may have been able to refute them, but if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion. And then he juxtaposes john Stuart Mill with Karl Marx, who said the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

Peterson starts his Arguemtnatition strong by emphezazing the ultimate Aim of this Piece, "How to properly change the World".  
He notes that the acoomplishemtn of this Aim needs to be judgegd on the Individulas perception of what is right.  
Aterwards heÂ´s stating that this enlightment of logic, recall "that u need to define the desired outcome of an action", is knew to him and got to his attention by wokrs from [Jonathan Hate]
