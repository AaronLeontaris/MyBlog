# Vienna

Arriving 2 hours before takeoff from Palermo I was not able to change my Laundry, so I stayed in Pisa Airport and waited for the other to arrive.  
The *others* are 3 Portuguese friends of mine i met during my first hours doing Erasmus.  
Was it determined or random that after our initial meetup we became good friends;  
I don't know and probably it doesn't matter, however I border an embarrassing cheap RyanAir flight to Vienna with them on a grey Tuesday morning.  

# hot wine and prata

After arriving in the airport and some sorting out of public transport we almost immediately went to the famous Vienna prata. To fix Pedros freezing we opted for his first hot wine of his life and my presumably 300th. He didn't like it so much so more hot wine for me :P.  
Vienna prata as well as the inner city was so beautiful this evening because the was still some frozen snow on the streets from the days before.

# I will buy a bidet

In Vienna we had a very cozy and practical AirBnB with a special treat. 
A built in bidet, hilalrouisly called "Popodusche".  
After Pedro discovered the thing and got kinda overwhelmed by the power of the beam, I tried it and I think its very good and way more hygienic then the West European Paper way.
Furthermore its part of the normal toilet and i don't need to move like a goblin to an external bidet and crouch down.
I.e. in my next flat I will buy a Bidet.

# New traveling mode unlocked

Since in both of my December trips it was not my duty to plan any activities nor accommodation i just left myself in the competent hands of Diana. And oh boy, these hands did magic. We saw every fckn sight in Vienna, Budapest and Milan; had clean and very cheap accommodation. Everything in these terms was just perfect and still we had the time to split up sometimes when interests diverged. Also there was no fight at all :OO.
