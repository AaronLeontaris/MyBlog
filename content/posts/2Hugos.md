# 20 Days in Hostel

It´s not that im stupids, sometimes i just make descisions on loose facts or misconceptions.  
For these story my misconseptions were:
- I dont need privacy
- only big Men can snorr fukin loud  
- it´s easy to find a flat in person

Before coming to Italy, i rly tried to find a place to stay, but i didnt.
Maybe I didnt try hard enough, maybe a lot of Italian laandlords dont want Eramsus Students or maybe my Italian was too bad to even get a text back.  
Allora, since i didnt have a place to stay for the first weeks, I decided to stay at the Staysafe Hostel in Pisa.  
I booked 20 Days in prior so I´d have an easy time finding accomodation.
The hostel was very clean, probably acchiecved by the fact that **EVERYONE** needs to leave their rooms between 12am and 3pm.  
In the coming weeks the cleaning staff learned to know me as the guy escaping his sheets in boxers and begging for 10 minutes more to shower.  
The food/drinks were expensive and kinda shitty, but as maybe this guy from "Saving James Ryan" put it:  

> *If the team hates the captain, the team gets stronger.*  
  
Ori, Musti, Hugo, Hugo, Marie, this crazy finish guy and so many more.
People I met at this time who i never want to forget.  



# Hugos, a German and the jouranlist

The first night in the hostel I met Hugo, a Norwegian Guy studying medicine in Poland and I met Hugo, a Japenese guy with French roots, travelling Europe because he wants a new place to live.  
I never met a Hugo before.  
I rly liked the Hugos.  
On the second night there the Hugos invited me to a dinner with another German guy and a journalist.  
We went to very goood pizzeria and had a few vine together.  
At a certain point the journalist revealed himselfe as such but he was not there to do a story, but just on an intermidiate stop to Roma.  
There were very good tallks that evenig and the Journalist happended to speak Norwegian, as he told us because he´s working for Norwegian State Televison sometimes. 
This all seemed kinda weired and as I looked up there were no flights to Roma on the next morning. 
For me 3 Possibilites emerged:
- he had a very bad psychosis
- he went by train and mixed these up
- he was a spy to observe Hugo
