# 20 Days in Hostel

ItÂ´s not that I'm stupids, sometimes i just make decisions on loose facts or misconceptions.  
For these story my misconceptions were:
- I don't need privacy
- only big Men can snorr fukin loud  
- it's easy to find a flat in person

Before coming to Italy, i rly tried to find a place to stay, but i didn't.
Maybe I didn't try hard enough, maybe a lot of Italian landlords don't want Erasmus Students or maybe my Italian was too bad to even get a text back.  
Allora, since i didn't have a place to stay for the first weeks, I decided to stay at the Staysafe Hostel in Pisa.  
I booked 20 Days in prior so I'd have an easy time finding accommodation.
The hostel was very clean, probably achieved by the fact that **EVERYONE** needs to leave their rooms between 12am and 3pm.  
In the coming weeks the cleaning staff learned to know me as the guy escaping his sheets in boxers and begging for 10 minutes more to shower.  
The food/drinks were expensive and kinda shitty, but as maybe this guy from "Saving James Ryan" put it:  

> *If the team hates the captain, the team gets stronger.*  
  
Ori, Musti, Hugo, Hugo, Marie, this crazy finish guy and so many more.
People I met at this time who i never want to forget.  



# Hugos, a German and the journalist

The first night in the hostel I met Hugo, a Norwegian Guy studying medicine in Poland and I met Hugo, a Japanese guy with French roots, traveling Europe because he wants a new place to live.  
I never met a Hugo before.  
I rly liked the Hugos.  
On the second night there the Hugos invited me to a dinner with another German guy and a journalist.  
We went to very goood pizzeria and had a few vine together.  
At a certain point the journalist revealed himself as such but he was not there to do a story, but just on an intermediate stop to Roma.  
There were very good talks that evening and the Journalist happened to speak Norwegian, as he told us because he's working for Norwegian State Television sometimes. 
This all seemed kinda weird and as I looked up there were no flights to Roma on the next morning. 
For me 3 Possibilities emerged:
- he had a very bad psychosis
- he went by train and mixed these up
- he was a spy to observe Hugo
