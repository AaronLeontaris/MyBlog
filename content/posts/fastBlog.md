# Hugo

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generation framework written in [Go](https://go.dev/).  
Hugo has several charachteristics that makes it somewhat the perfect framewwork to build modern webapps that do not need a database connection.  
It has very fast build times, a vast collection of templates to choose from and extensive possibilites for extensions.  
And all of that with basic knowledge of HTML and Markdown.  
Furthermore the documentation is very good and because of the high popluarity of this framework pared with it beeing open source we can expect a longevity.  

## Static Sites

The most modern website we encounter are dynamic websites, what means the site may look diffrent from User to User.  
This is because the content may change according to user or device prefrences due to account permissions or database state.  
Static websites, in most cases neither need to connect to a databse nor do they have a user management.  
This leads to fewer http request and increased loading speeds.
