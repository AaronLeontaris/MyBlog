# The day before

Before starting my journey to Pisa I had a last evening in Göttingen. I had the honor to spend the last hours with some of the nicest and most handsome people in the world.

We did a wine tasting that kinda got out of hand.

The evening ended with Gabriel and me stuck on field in front of Göttingen at 3 am because Google Maps is hard to handle and we didnt find the way to a club.  

# Trip to Munich

I woke up way too late and spent the last minutes chatting with Gabo about random stuff instead of showering.  
Stupid idea.  
Beeing stuck in an ICE sticky and smelly for 5 hours is rly not a nice thing.  
In the end me and the chair were pretty much one unit.  
But at least i was hydrated thanks to the water bottle my friends gifted me. &#128147;

When arriving in Munich i had some time for the transfere so I decided to take a shower in the train station what was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Afterwards i drank a Helles and ate a pizza for 10 Euros, what is a fraggin good price for Munich. Afterwards i spent too much money on shitty coffee in a starbucks and waited for the night train to arrive.

The night train trip to Milan was pretty much as shitty as it could have been.  
There was Romanian industry worker sitting infront of me so i couldnt move my seat to sleep postiton and after we agreed to put our feet next to each other i couldnt sleep beacuse i was affraid to die because of the smell.  
After arriving in Milan i took the regional train through Italys country side for 5 more hours.  
I was in so many reginoal but beautiful train terminals.
